## Order Requests

Clients may submit new order requests, make order request cancellations, and retrieve status for virtual lab services and room rental services.

Before booking your event, an order request goes through an internal verification process to ensure that all resources needed for a successful delivery are present. During this process, our account management team may contact you to obtain additional information.

The following endpoints are currently available.
