## Environments

MicroTek offers two API environments - Development and Production.

Please use our development environment while building and testing your integrations.

Environment | Uri
----------- | ---
Development | <%= config[:api_host_dev] %>
Production | <%= config[:api_host_prod] %>

Please note that all API requests must be made using HTTPS. Requests that use a non-secure URI will be rejected.
