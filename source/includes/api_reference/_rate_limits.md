## Rate Limits

Attune APIs are subject to rate limiting. If you exceed the limits, Attune will start returning a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP status code. We apply rate limits to prevent abuse, spam, denial-of-service attacks, and similar issues. Our goal is to keep the limits high enough so that any application using Attune as intended will never hit them.
